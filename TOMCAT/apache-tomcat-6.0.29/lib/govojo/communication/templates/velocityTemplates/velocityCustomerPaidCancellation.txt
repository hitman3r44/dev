Dear ^${firstname},

We're sorry to see that you have cancelled your GPlay membership. 
For a limited time, we are offering you 5 free days to try us out 
again, no strings attached. 

You won't be sorry! Here are the things we are doing to improve the 
service for our members:

   * We are getting more copies of the games you want to play!
   * We plan to open another mailing facility on the East Coast for 
     faster shipments!
   * New website features including buying games you liked, fully 
     scanned game manuals, and customized recommendations!


If you wish to reactivate your membership, please reply to this 
message with the word "REACTIVATE" in the subject line. If you wish 
to cancel after your 5 free days, simply email us and we'll have 
your account deactivated immediately.

What are you waiting for?  We're ready to send you your games!

Sincerely,
GPlay Customer Service
