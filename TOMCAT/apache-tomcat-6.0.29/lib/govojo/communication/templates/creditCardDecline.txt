Dear #FIRSTNAME#,

On #TODAY#, we attempted to charge your credit card 
for our video game rental service.  Unfortunately, your card 
came back as declined from our merchant bank. Please make a
a payment on this card or update your credit card information
in the "My Account" section at the URL below.

We will attempt to bill you again in 5 days.  Until then, we must 
temporarily suspend all video game shipments.  Once you have been
properly billed, we will immediately restart sending games.

If you need any assistance please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for choosing Game Access,

The Game Access Team
