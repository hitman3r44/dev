Dear #FIRSTNAME#,As per your request, your Platinum account with GameAccess.ca has been cancelled.We would appreciate any feedback concerning the reasons of your cancellation. Any comments you provide us with will help us improve our service for current and future members.If you wish to reactivate your membership at a later date, please contact our customer service department here:http://www.gameaccess.ca/displayContactUs.jspPlease return immediately any games you are currently holding. If we have not received them within 10 days of your cancellation date, a membership fee will be charged, and this every month until we receive all our games back. Depending on your account settings, you will receive a confirmation email when the games have arrived safely.SHIPPING THESE GAMES IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS IS WHY WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE A TRACKABLE SHIPPING METHOD (Canada Post XpressPost or other). UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIABLE PROOF, YOU WILL BE FULLY LIABLE FOR THE COST OF ALL UNRETURNED GAMES.NOTE:  Depending on your account settings, when we receive your game(s) back, we will send you a confirmation email. This email states that we will ship you another game if your account is currently active, which is not your case, therefore please disregard.Thank you,The Game Access Team*---- Helpful Links ----*Contact Us - http://www.gameaccess.ca/displayContactUs.jspMy Account - http://www.gameaccess.ca/myAccount.doFAQ - http://www.gameaccess.ca/displayFAQ.jsp
