Dear #FIRSTNAME#,

Your account with GameAccess.ca has been cancelled as you 
requested.

Please let us know if there is a particular reason for your 
cancellation. Your comments will help us improve our service 
for current and future members.

If you decide to reactivate your membership at a later date, 
please contact our customer service department here:

Please return any games you are currently holding immediately.
If we have not received them within 10 days of your cancellation
date, a membership fee will be charged until we do get the games.
You will receive a confirmation email when the games have arrived
safely.

SHIPPING THESE GAMES IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND AT YOUR 
OWN RISK. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE A TRACKABLE SHIPPING METHOD
(XpressPost, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Purolator, etc). UNLESS YOU HAVE
VERIFIABLE PROOF, YOU WILL BE FULLY LIABLE FOR THE COST OF ALL
UNRETURNED GAMES.

NOTE:  When we receive your game back, we will send you a 
confirmation email. This email states that we will ship you 
another game. Please disregard this as it only applies
to current members.


Thank you,

The Game Access Team
